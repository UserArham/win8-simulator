Windows 8 Simulator is a system emulator by NanoTech Sprunki Code.

This may provide an clear thought for Windows as this may be an look series of the Windows Simulator.
Download win8-simulator.zip if you want an clear view! You may view with 8K but download is 2110p.
Apps and tiles provide an "SICK!!!" thought cause this was a copy of some Microsoft features.

Use it now! This was not an real one owned by Microsoft. This is owned by nanoTech Sprunki Code.
This was made with React and Tailwind, as requested.
This is used for Linux (Ubuntu), macOS, ChromeOS, Windows, and other! 
This is not made by AI like ChatGPT or Copilt in GitHub. I am just making it by my own.

Give it an good and "SICK!!!" review!
